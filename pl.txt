compiler
	converts high level language to low level language


stages of a compiler

1. Parsing:
	take the sources code and turn it into a representation of that code. 

2. Transformation:
	Take that source code and transforms it to do what the compiler wants it to do.

3. Generation:
  	Takes the transformed representation and turns it into a new string of code
